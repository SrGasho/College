# Child Mind Institute — Problematic Internet Use 

## Description

This repository provides a predictive solution for the [Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use) competition. The goal is to estimate problematic internet use (PIU) in children and adolescents using biometric, demographic, psychological questionnaire data, and time-series sensor inputs.

It includes tabular feature processing, optional LLM-based text embeddings, and model training using XGBoost with stratified cross-validation.

## Usage

1. **Place the competition data** in the project directory.

   If you have the Kaggle API configured, run:
     ```
     kaggle competitions download -c child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use
     ```

   OR you can download the data by clicking the folder above.

   At the bottom of the page you will find the download links for all files.

   Make sure your data is in src folder for the implementation
3. **Run the pipeline**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## System Overview

The system consists of the following stages:

- **Data Loading**: Loads tabular and time-series data using `pandas` and `pyarrow`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts biometric ratios, age buckets, and sensor-based metrics (e.g., enmo, light streaks).
- **Optional LLM Embedding**: Transforms psychometric responses into natural-language-like strings and encodes them into dense vectors via `SentenceTransformer`.
- **Model Training**: Applies `XGBoost` with Stratified K-Fold validation. Includes threshold optimization for ordinal classification.
- **Output Generation**: Creates a `submission.csv` file ready for Kaggle submission.

## Submission Format

The output `submission.csv` file will contain:

```
id,sii
00008ff9,3
000fd460,0
...
```

Where `sii` is the predicted score (integer between 0 and 3).

## Notes on LLM

If enabled, the system uses `SentenceTransformer` (MiniLM) to create semantic embeddings from questionnaire responses. This enhances model expressiveness by capturing latent psychological traits. The embeddings are integrated as numerical features alongside engineered data.
